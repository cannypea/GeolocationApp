# GeolocationApp
Here is an example of a JavaScript code for a simple location app that uses the browser's geolocation API to get the user's current coordinates
This code first checks if the browser supports geolocation and if it does, it calls the navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition() method to get the user's current coordinates. The showPosition function is called with the position object as an argument, which contains the latitude and longitude properties. These values are then logged to the console.
